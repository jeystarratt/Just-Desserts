# Just Desserts

An example SwiftUI app that allows users to browse dessert recipes with [TheMealDB API](https://themealdb.com/api.php).

## Requirements
* The desserts should be sorted alphabetically.
* When the user selects a dessert, they should see the name of the dessert, instructions, and the ingredients with their measurements.

## Considerations Made
Support for...
* Dark mode
* VoiceOver
* Dynamic Type

## Future Enhancements
* Search by dessert name
* iPad-specific layout
